## How can I run my program?
- compile your source code using command `g++ a.cpp`. It will create by default `a.out` file which is runnable
- run runnable file `./a.out`
##### If you want to create seperate runnable files for each source code, then do following command:
- pass name of the output file while compiling `g++ b.cpp -o b.out` 
- and run that output file `./b.out`
